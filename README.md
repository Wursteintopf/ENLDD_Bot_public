# ENLDD_Bot_public

This is a simple Telegram Bot originally built to administer Telegramchats for an Enlightened Ingress Community, though you can copy it and use it in any other way, as you wish.

## How to use it?

Well, just fill the json files in the resource directory with any information needed (most important are of course Bot Token and Bot Username) and then just fire it up with `mvn exec:java`. (Or compile and run it by yourself, just as you wish.)
